   - Suitable for managing and automating CI/CD pipelines for multiple branches.

## FREE STYLE JENKINS JOB

Creating and configuring a Jenkins Freestyle job is a straightforward process. A Freestyle job allows you to define a series of build steps that execute in the order you specify. Here's a step-by-step guide to creating and configuring a Jenkins Freestyle job:

1. **Access Jenkins:**
   - Log in to the Jenkins web interface.

2. **Create a New Freestyle Job:**
   - Click on "New Item" in the Jenkins dashboard.
   - Enter a name for your job (e.g., "MyFreestyleJob").
   - Select "Freestyle project" and click "OK."

3. **Configure General Settings:**
   - In the job configuration page, you'll see various sections. Start with the "General" section:
     - Enter a brief description for the job (optional).
     - Choose the "Discard old builds" option to manage build retention.

4. **Configure Source Code Management (Optional):**
   - If your project requires source code management, select the appropriate SCM system (Git, Subversion, etc.) and provide the necessary repository information.

5. **Configure Build Steps:**
   - In the "Build" section, click "Add build step" and choose the type of build step you want to add.
   - Common build step types include:
     - "Execute shell": Run shell commands or scripts.

     - "Invoke Ant": Run Apache Ant tasks.
     - "Invoke Gradle": Run Gradle build tasks.
     - "Invoke Maven": Run Maven build tasks.
     - "Execute shell" and "Execute Windows batch command" are commonly used for simple scripts.

6. **Configure Post-Build Actions:**
   - After the build steps, you can configure post-build actions to be executed after the build completes.
   - Common post-build actions include:
     - "Archive the artifacts": Archive build artifacts (files, reports) for future reference.
     - "Publish JUnit test result report": Publish test results.
     - "Send build artifacts over SSH": Transfer artifacts to a remote server over SSH.

7. **Configure Build Triggers (Optional):**
   - In the "Build Triggers" section, you can configure triggers that start the build:
     - "Build periodically": Schedule the build to run at specific intervals.
     - "Poll SCM": Poll the source code repository for changes and trigger builds.

8. **Save Configuration:**
   - Once you've configured the job settings, click "Save" to save your changes.

9. **Run the Job:**
   - After saving, you can manually trigger the job by clicking "Build Now."

10. **View Build Results:**
    - After the build runs, you can view the build results, console output, and any artifacts produced.

## Jenkins Pipeline Job

Here's a simple Jenkins pipeline example with stages that include the steps "git checkout," "mvn compile," "mvn test," and "mvn package." This pipeline is defined using the Declarative Pipeline syntax in a Jenkinsfile:

```groovy
pipeline {
    agent any
    
    stages {
        stage('Checkout') {
            steps {
                // Check out the source code from the repository
                git branch: 'main', url: 'https://github.com/your/repo.git'
            }
        }
        
        stage('Compile') {
            steps {
                // Compile the code using Maven
                sh 'mvn compile'
            }
        }
        
        stage('Test') {
            steps {
                // Run tests using Maven
                sh 'mvn test'
            }
        }
        
        stage('Package') {
            steps {
                // Package the application using Maven
                sh 'mvn package'
            }
        }
    }
    
    post {
        always {
            // Archive the build artifacts
            archiveArtifacts artifacts: '**/target/*.jar', allowEmptyArchive: true
        }
    }
}
```

In this example:

- The `agent any` directive specifies that the pipeline can run on any available agent.
- The `stages` block defines four stages: Checkout, Compile, Test, and Package.
- Each stage has a `steps` block with the appropriate commands to perform the desired actions.
- After all stages are completed, the `post` block archives the build artifacts (JAR files in this case).

Remember to replace `'https://github.com/your/repo.git'` with the actual URL of your Git repository. Also, ensure that Maven (`mvn`) is installed on the Jenkins agent where the pipeline will run.

# Jenkins Shared library

Jenkins Shared Libraries allow you to define reusable code, functions, and steps that can be shared across multiple pipelines. This promotes code reuse, consistency, and maintainability in your Jenkins pipelines. Here's an explanation of the concept with an example using a Declarative Pipeline:

**1. Create the Shared Library:**

1.1. In your version control system (e.g., Git), create a repository for your shared library code.

1.2. Inside the repository, create a `vars` directory. This is where you'll define your reusable pipeline steps.

1.3. In the `vars` directory, create a Groovy file (e.g., `mySharedSteps.groovy`) for your shared steps.

1.4. Define the shared steps in the Groovy file. For example, let's create a simple step that echoes a message:

```groovy
// vars/mySharedSteps.groovy
def echoMessage(message) {
    echo "Shared Library says: ${message}"
}
```

**2. Configure Jenkins to Use the Shared Library:**

2.1. In Jenkins, go to "Manage Jenkins" > "Configure System."

2.2. Under the "Global Pipeline Libraries" section, add a new library:
   - Name: Enter a name for your library (e.g., `MySharedLibrary`).
   - Default version: Specify a branch or tag in your repository.
   - Retrieval method: Choose "Modern SCM" and select your version control system (e.g., Git).
   - Project repository: Enter the URL of your shared library repository.

2.3. Save the configuration.

**3. Using the Shared Library in a Declarative Pipeline:**

3.1. In your project's Jenkinsfile, you can now use the shared steps defined in your library:

```groovy
@Library('MySharedLibrary') _
pipeline {
    agent any
    
    stages {
        stage('Use Shared Steps') {
            steps {
                script {
                    echoMessage("Hello from Shared Library!")
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

3.2. The `@Library` annotation imports and uses the shared library in your pipeline.

3.3. The `echoMessage` step is provided by the shared library and can be used directly in your pipeline.

**4. Benefits of Shared Libraries:**

- **Code Reusability:** You can define complex logic, common patterns, and custom steps in the shared library and use them across multiple pipelines.
- **Consistency:** Shared libraries ensure that the same logic is applied consistently across different pipelines.
- **Maintainability:** Updates and improvements made to the shared library are automatically reflected in all pipelines that use it.
- **Versioning:** You can control which version of the shared library is used in your pipelines by specifying the library version in your Jenkinsfile.
- **Separation of Concerns:** By centralizing common functionality in the library, your pipeline definitions become more focused on the specific tasks of your project.

Shared Libraries are a powerful way to extend the capabilities of your Jenkins pipelines and promote best practices and standardization across your organization's CI/CD processes.

## Skipping stages in jenkins pipeline

In a Jenkins Declarative Pipeline, you can use the `when` directive to conditionally skip stages based on certain conditions. The `when` directive allows you to define a condition using Groovy scripting, and if the condition is met, the specified stage will be executed; otherwise, it will be skipped. Here's an example of using the `when` directive to skip a stage in a pipeline:

```groovy
pipeline {
    agent any
    
    stages {
        stage('Checkout') {
            steps {
                // Checkout code from repository
                script {
                    checkout scm
                }
            }
        }
        
        stage('Build') {
            steps {
                // Build the project
                sh 'mvn clean package'
            }
        }
        
        stage('Deploy') {
            when {
                expression {
                    // Condition to skip the stage
                    return params.SKIP_DEPLOY == 'true'
                }
            }
            steps {
                // Deploy the application
                echo 'Deploying...'
            }
        }
        
        stage('Test') {
            steps {
                // Run tests
                sh 'mvn test'
            }
        }
    }
}
```

In this example:

- The `Deploy` stage is conditionally skipped based on the value of the `SKIP_DEPLOY` parameter.
- The `expression` block contains the Groovy condition that determines whether the stage should be skipped. In this case, if the `SKIP_DEPLOY` parameter is set to `'true'`, the `Deploy` stage will be skipped.
- The `when` directive allows you to control the execution of stages using a Groovy expression.

You can customize the condition in the `expression` block to suit your requirements. You can use environment variables, parameters, or any other variables accessible in the pipeline context to define your condition.

Keep in mind that the `when` directive is used to control the execution of stages, but it does not prevent the entire pipeline from running. Other stages will still be executed regardless of whether a specific stage is skipped.

## Jenkins Backup 

Taking backups of your Jenkins instance is crucial to ensure that you can recover your configuration, jobs, and data in case of system failures or other issues. Jenkins provides several ways to take backups, including manual and automated methods. Here's how you can take backups in Jenkins:

**1. Manual Backup:**

**Backup Jobs:**
   - For Freestyle and Declarative Pipeline jobs, manually copy the job configurations from the Jenkins web interface.
   - For Pipeline jobs defined in a Jenkinsfile, ensure your pipeline scripts are versioned in your version control system.

**Backup Data Directory:**
   - The Jenkins data directory (often located at `/var/lib/jenkins` or a custom path) contains important files and configurations.
   - Create a backup of this directory, including the jobs directory, plugins directory, and other configuration files.

**2. Automated Backup:**

**ThinBackup Plugin:**
   - Install the "ThinBackup" plugin from the Jenkins Plugin Manager.
   - Configure the plugin to schedule automated backups of your Jenkins instance.
   - Backups can be stored locally, on a remote server, or in cloud storage.

**Jenkins Backup to Amazon S3:**
   - If you're using Amazon Web Services (AWS), you can use the "Jenkins Backup to Amazon S3" plugin to automatically back up your Jenkins configuration and data to an S3 bucket.

**Scripted Backup:**
   - You can write custom scripts to automate the backup process, including copying the data directory, job configurations, and other important files to a backup location.

**3. Docker Backup:**

If you're running Jenkins in a Docker container, consider using Docker-related backup mechanisms to create snapshots or export container data. Docker volumes can be backed up to ensure data persistence.

**Important Considerations:**

- Test your backup and restoration process in a non-production environment to ensure it works as expected.
- Store backups securely, preferably in an offsite location or cloud storage.
- Keep backup procedures and documentation up to date.
- Regularly review and update backup strategies based on changes in your Jenkins configuration and infrastructure.

Remember that backups are a critical part of disaster recovery planning, so ensure that you have a well-defined backup strategy that aligns with your organization's needs and requirements.


# Troubleshooting

Troubleshooting in Jenkins involves identifying and resolving issues that can occur during the build, test, and deployment processes. Here are some common troubleshooting scenarios, along with examples and solutions:

**1. Jenkins Job Fails to Start:**

**Scenario:** A Jenkins job fails to start, and you're not sure why.

**Solution:**

# Jenkins DO's & DON'Ts

Jenkins is a widely used open-source automation server that facilitates the process of building, testing, and deploying software projects. Following best practices with Jenkins helps ensure a smooth and efficient software development pipeline. Here are some do's and don'ts that are commonly followed in the industry:

**Do's:**

1. **Version Control Integration:**
   - **Do:** Integrate Jenkins with your version control system (e.g., Git) to trigger builds automatically when changes are pushed.
   - **Why:** This ensures that every code change is built and tested, maintaining code quality and catching issues early.

2. **Pipeline as Code:**
   - **Do:** Define your build and deployment pipelines using code (e.g., Jenkinsfile for Jenkins pipelines).
   - **Why:** This approach allows versioning, code review, and simplifies pipeline maintenance.

3. **Automated Testing:**
   - **Do:** Incorporate automated testing (unit, integration, and functional tests) into your pipeline.
   - **Why:** Automated tests catch bugs early, reduce manual intervention, and ensure code quality.

4. **Artifact Management:**
   - **Do:** Use an artifact repository (e.g., Nexus, Artifactory) to store build artifacts.
   - **Why:** Storing artifacts centrally ensures consistent and reliable deployment of your software.

5. **Parallelization:**
   - **Do:** Parallelize your pipeline stages and tests to speed up the build process.
   - **Why:** Faster feedback loops and reduced build times lead to more efficient development.

6. **Security Scanning:**
   - **Do:** Integrate security scanning tools to analyze code for vulnerabilities.
   - **Why:** Identify and address security issues early in the development lifecycle.

7. **Environment Isolation:**
   - **Do:** Use isolated environments for different stages of the pipeline (development, testing, production).
   - **Why:** This prevents interference between stages and helps maintain consistent testing environments.

**Don'ts:**

1. **Manual Steps:**
   - **Don't:** Rely on manual interventions within your pipeline.
   - **Why:** Manual steps introduce delays and potential human errors.

2. **Complex Pipelines:**
   - **Don't:** Create overly complex pipelines that are hard to understand and maintain.
   - **Why:** Complexity hinders troubleshooting and increases the likelihood of errors.

3. **Hardcoded Credentials:**
   - **Don't:** Store credentials or sensitive information directly in pipeline scripts.
   - **Why:** Hardcoding credentials poses a security risk. Use credential management solutions.

4. **Inadequate Error Handling:**
   - **Don't:** Neglect error handling and notification mechanisms.
   - **Why:** Proper error handling ensures issues are promptly addressed and teams are informed.

5. **Ignoring Monitoring and Logs:**
   - **Don't:** Neglect monitoring and logging of your Jenkins server and pipelines.
   - **Why:** Monitoring helps identify performance bottlenecks and abnormal behavior.

6. **Skipping Tests:**
   - **Don't:** Skip automated tests to save time.
   - **Why:** Skipping tests compromises code quality and may lead to unexpected issues in production.

Remember that best practices may vary depending on the specific needs and technologies of your organization. Regularly reviewing and updating your Jenkins practices based on lessons learned is crucial to maintaining an efficient and effective development process.
