Certainly! Here's your Jenkins pipeline code converted to Markdown format:

```groovy
# Jenkins Pipeline

pipeline {
    agent any
    tools {
        jdk 'jdk17'
        maven 'maven3'
    }
    environment {
        SCANNER_HOME = tool 'sonar-scanner'
    }

    stages {

                sh "mvn clean compile"
            }
        }


        stage('Package') {
            steps {
                sh "mvn clean package"
            }
        }
       

        stage('Sonar Analysis') {
            steps {
                withSonarQubeEnv('sonar') {
                    sh ''' 
                    $SCANNER_HOME/bin/sonar-scanner -Dsonar.projectName=Devops-CICD \
                    -Dsonar.java.binaries=. \
                    -Dsonar.projectKey=Devops-CICD 
                    '''
                }
            }
        }

        stage('Quality Gate Check') {
            steps {
                timeout(time: 10, unit: 'MINUTES') {
                    script {
                        def qualityGateStatus = waitForQualityGate()

                        if (qualityGateStatus == 'OK') {
                            echo 'Quality gate passed! Proceeding with the pipeline.'
                        } else {
                            error 'Quality gate failed. Stopping the pipeline.'
                        }
                    }
                }
            }
        }
        
    }
}
```

Remember that Markdown formatting might not capture all the intricacies of your pipeline code, so double-check the syntax and structure when implementing it in your documentation or tools that support Markdown.


# Sonar Analysis using Maven

Certainly! Analyzing a project using SonarQube with Maven involves several steps. Below are the detailed steps to perform a SonarQube analysis using Maven:

```xml
<plugins>
    <plugin>
        <groupId>org.sonarsource.scanner.maven</groupId>
        <artifactId>sonar-maven-plugin</artifactId>
        <version>3.9.0.2155</version> <!-- Replace with the latest version -->
    </plugin>
</plugins>
```

2. Define the SonarQube properties in your `pom.xml` to specify the SonarQube server URL, project key, project name, and project version. Add the following properties inside the `<properties>` section:

```xml
<properties>
    <sonar.host.url>http://your-sonarqube-server-url</sonar.host.url>
    <sonar.projectKey>unique-project-key</sonar.projectKey>
    <sonar.projectName>Your Project Name</sonar.projectName>
    <sonar.projectVersion>1.0</sonar.projectVersion>
</properties>
```

**Step 3: Generate SonarQube Token**

1. Log in to your SonarQube server.
