## Kubernetes resources:

1. **Deployment**:
   - A Deployment in Kubernetes is a resource that allows you to define, create, and manage a set of identical pods. It provides features such as rolling updates, scaling, and rollback.

   Sample YAML for a basic Deployment:

   ```yaml
   apiVersion: apps/v1
   kind: Deployment
   metadata:
     name: example-deployment
   spec:
     replicas: 3
     selector:
       matchLabels:
         app: example
     template:
       metadata:
         labels:
           app: example
       spec:
         containers:
         - name: nginx
           image: nginx:latest
   ```

2. **Service**:
   - A Service in Kubernetes is an abstraction that defines a logical set of pods and a policy by which to access them. It enables network access to a set of pods.

   Sample YAML for a basic Service (LoadBalancer type):

   ```yaml
   apiVersion: v1
   kind: Service
   metadata:
     name: example-service
   spec:
     selector:
       app: example
     ports:
       - protocol: TCP
         port: 80
         targetPort: 80
     type: LoadBalancer
   ```

3. **ConfigMap**:
   - A ConfigMap in Kubernetes is a way to store configuration data separate from application code. It allows you to decouple configuration from your pods.

   Sample YAML for a basic ConfigMap:

   ```yaml
   apiVersion: v1
   kind: ConfigMap
   metadata:
     name: example-config
   data:
     key1: value1
     key2: value2
   ```

4. **Secrets**:
   - A Secret in Kubernetes is an object that allows you to store sensitive information, such as passwords, OAuth tokens, and ssh keys. They are stored in a base64 encoded format.

   Sample YAML for a basic Secret:

   ```yaml
   apiVersion: v1
   kind: Secret
   metadata:
     name: example-secret
   type: Opaque
   data:
     username: dXNlcm5hbWU=
     password: cGFzc3dvcmQ=
   ```

            configMapKeyRef:
              name: mongodb-configmap
              key: db_host
```

These YAML configuration are Kubernetes manifest file that defines various resources for deploying a MongoDB database and a web-based MongoDB management tool called "mongo-express." Let's break down the different sections and resources defined in this configuration:

1. **ConfigMap (mongodb-configmap)**:
   - `apiVersion: v1`: Specifies the Kubernetes API version for this resource.
   - `kind: ConfigMap`: Defines a ConfigMap resource, which is used to store configuration data.
   - `metadata`: Metadata for the ConfigMap, including its name.
   - `data`: This section contains key-value pairs of configuration data. In this case, it defines a key `db_host` with the value `mongodb-service`. This configuration data can be used by other components in the Kubernetes cluster.

2. **Secret (mongodb-secret)**:
   - `apiVersion: v1`: Specifies the Kubernetes API version for this resource.
   - `kind: Secret`: Defines a Secret resource, which is used to store sensitive data, typically in base64-encoded form.
   - `metadata`: Metadata for the Secret, including its name.
   - `type: Opaque`: Specifies that this Secret is a generic, opaque secret (not specific to TLS certificates).
   - `data`: This section contains key-value pairs of sensitive data. It includes a username and password, both base64-encoded. These credentials are likely used for authenticating to the MongoDB database.

3. **Deployment (mongodb)**:
   - `apiVersion: apps/v1`: Specifies the Kubernetes API version for this resource.
   - `kind: Deployment`: Defines a Deployment resource, which manages the desired state of a set of pods.
   - `metadata`: Metadata for the Deployment, including its name and labels.
   - `spec`: Defines the desired state and configuration of the Deployment. It specifies that one replica of the MongoDB pod should be running.
   - `containers`: Specifies the containers running in the pod. In this case, there is a container named "mongodb" based on the "mongo" image. It also sets environment variables for the MongoDB root username and password using values from the "mongodb-secret."

4. **Service (mongodb-service)**:
   - `apiVersion: v1`: Specifies the Kubernetes API version for this resource.
   - `kind: Service`: Defines a Service resource, which provides network access to pods.
   - `metadata`: Metadata for the Service, including its name.
   - `spec`: Defines the selector to match pods (based on labels) and the port mapping. This service exposes port 27017 and is likely used to access the MongoDB database.

5. **Deployment (mongo-express)**:
   - Similar to the "mongodb" Deployment, this defines a Deployment for "mongo-express," a web-based MongoDB management tool.
   - It specifies one replica of the "mongo-express" pod, sets environment variables for the MongoDB admin username and password (using values from "mongodb-secret"), and specifies the "mongo-express" image.

6. **Service (mongo-express-service)**:
   - Defines a Service resource for "mongo-express" with a LoadBalancer type, meaning it can be accessed externally.
   - It exposes port 8081, which is likely the port used for accessing the "mongo-express" web interface. The `nodePort` is set to 30000, indicating that it will be exposed on this port on the cluster nodes.

In summary, this YAML configuration sets up a Kubernetes cluster with a MongoDB database and a web-based MongoDB management tool (mongo-express). It uses ConfigMaps and Secrets to manage configuration and sensitive data and defines Services to allow external access to the MongoDB and mongo-express components.

## Different types of Kubernetes services:

1. **ClusterIP**:
   - **Description**: ClusterIP is the default type of service. It exposes the service on an internal IP within the cluster. This means that the service is only reachable from within the cluster and is not accessible from outside the cluster.
   - **Use Cases**: ClusterIP is often used for services that need to communicate with other services within the cluster, but do not need to be accessed from outside the cluster. For example, a database service that other services in the cluster need to connect to.

2. **NodePort**:
   - **Description**: NodePort exposes the service on a specific port on each node in the cluster. This means that the service is accessible via `<NodeIP>:<NodePort>`. Kubernetes automatically routes traffic that is sent to this port to one of the service's pods.
   - **Use Cases**: NodePort is useful when you need to expose a service to the outside world. It's typically used in development or testing environments. It's not generally used in production as it exposes the service on all nodes, which might not be desirable.

3. **LoadBalancer**:
   - **Description**: LoadBalancer provides external access to the service by setting up a load balancer that distributes traffic across all the pods in the service. The external load balancer is provisioned by the cloud provider (like AWS, GCP, Azure) and it assigns a public IP address to the service.
   - **Use Cases**: LoadBalancer is used when you want to expose a service to the internet. This is typically used in production environments where you want to ensure high availability and distribute incoming traffic across multiple pods.
